# Purpose
This repository contains code and analysis for exploring the environmental and socioeconomic impacts of historical redlining practices LA County. The project investigates how Home Owners’ Loan Corporation (HOLC) grades relate to environmental burdens, biodiversity and social vulnerability today.

# Repository Structure
This repository includes:
  - .gitignore: a file where we name files to ignore when we push to Github

  - .Rhistory: a file that describes the historical changes of the files

  - data: Contains datasets including HOLC shapefiles, environmental injustice data, and bird diversity data

  - HW2.qmd: a file where the analysis and visualization takes place
